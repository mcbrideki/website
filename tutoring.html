        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>My goal as a math tutor and teacher has always been for my students to enjoy and appreciate mathematics, and not just chase grades. I believe that every person has the ability to understand mathematics, and that in learning math we also learn important problem-solving and critical thinking skills useful in all realms of life. I take a student-driven approach to tutoring and adjust my teaching style for every student I encounter. I make a point to constantly search for new ways of understanding and explaining the same topic, and generally follow the Socratic method of sharing thought-invoking questions with my students. I treat each problem as something to explore together, so that my students can enjoy the feeling of solving it for themselves, rather than just being taught a method.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I have a wide range of tutoring experience, having worked with ages 6 to adult learners. Much of my experience has been with high school and middle school students as an additional support during school years. I have also created my own lesson plans and held complete lessons during the summer and COVID 19 pandemic. I also have experience tutoring for the SAT and ACT standardized tests, as well as college level classes. Finally, I have worked with many ADHD, ADD, Dyslexic, and ODD students.</p>

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>My goal as a math tutor and teacher has always been for my students to enjoy and appreciate mathematics, and not just chase grades. I believe that every person has the ability to understand mathematics, and that in learning math we also learn important problem-solving and critical thinking skills useful in all realms of life. I take a student-driven approach to tutoring and adjust my teaching style for every student I encounter. I make a point to constantly search for new ways of understanding and explaining the same topic, and generally follow the Socratic method of sharing thought-invoking questions with my students. I treat each problem as something to explore together, so that my students can enjoy the feeling of solving it for themselves, rather than just being taught a method.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I have a wide range of tutoring experience, having worked with ages 6 to adult learners. Much of my experience has been with high school and middle school students as an additional support during school years. I have also created my own lesson plans and held complete lessons during the summer and COVID 19 pandemic. I also have experience tutoring for the SAT and ACT standardized tests, as well as college level classes. Finally, I have worked with many ADHD, ADD, Dyslexic, and ODD students.</p>

        <h2>Testimonials</h2>
        <p>"My son has some learning challenges and regular schooling wasn’t able to offer him the proper time and attention to address it. But Kiki’s patience and creative lessons got him to focus his attention span and understand the material on his own terms. It was really refreshing to see his lessons tailored to his unique way of processing information and really helped with his own confidence, too. It was such a blessing to find Kiki’s help!"<br> -Kelly P.</p>
